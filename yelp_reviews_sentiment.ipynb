Both were tasty, the chicken salad is a bit creamy but was perfect with quinoa on the side.  This is a good lunch joint, casual and clean! \n\nPOSITIVE: Went here last night and got oysters, fried okra, fries, and onion rings. I cannot complain. The portions were great and tasty!!! I will definitely be back for more. I cannot wait to try the crawfish boudin and soft shell crab. \n\nPOSITIVE: This restaurant was fantastic! \nThe concept of eating without vision was intriguing. The dinner was filled with laughs and good conversation. \n\nWe were lead in a line to our table and each person to their seat. This was not just dark but you could not see something right in front of your face. \n\nThe waiters/waitresses were all blind and allowed us to see how aware you need to be without the vision. \n\nTaking away one sense is said to increase your other senses so as taste and hearing which I believed to be true in this experience. \n\nThe meal was extremely delicious. I had the chicken and it was cooked to perfection. I also had a surprise beer which was a nice surprise. \n\nThe whole experience was unlike anything I have ever done and I hope this spreads to other cities. \n\nA must do! \n\nNEGATIVE: They won't book new patients for same day appointments. My dog is sick but it's not necessarily urgent so I asked when I would be able to book an appointment and was told \"new patients book out at least 6 weeks in advance\" so just a heads up this seems like a great vet from other reviews but it'll be hard to get in their system to know \n\n"
